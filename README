This project is comprised of multiple portions.

1.) Data collection
    I obtained this data set from publicly available pages on www.boardgamegeek.com.
    This code was written in perl, and collected JSON-formatted data on each game.
    The games were then consolidated into a CSV format to be easily read into a python Pandas DataFrame.

2.) Modeling and Evaluation
    This portion comprised the bulk of the project, and was implemented in python, within an iPython notebook.
    Executing this notebook to completion requires an hour or more, depending on the speed/size of the hardware used,
    and the number of jobs set via a variable at the top of the notebook. A PDF of the notebook executed to completion
    is included in the 'Notebook' subdirectory.

    The following python packages would be needed to execute this notebook. Each could be installed with the following command:
    > pip install <package_name>
     - numpy        (1.11.1 used)
     - pandas       (0.13.1 used)
     - matplotlib   (1.5.1 used, for ggplot)
     - sklearn      (0.17 used)
     - scipy        (0.13.3)
